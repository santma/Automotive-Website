# Automotive-Website
Full-Stack Web Development work-in-progress for a local Automotive shop using HTML/CSS and Bootstrap.

This is a custom wordpress theme made from sctratch. It includes a Homepage, a Services page, and 
single pages for each service offered.The made objective for the site is to provide an honest portrait of the company.
This is doen by providing information about the staff, photos of the shop and educational pages for common
services provided.

I also used plugins Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) to input all of the content, which is can be optimized through Yoast SEO
using the Yoast SEO for ACF plugin. Smart Slider is included in the front page, and I highly recommend it for the ease
and responsiveness.

The Navigation bar is custom-built and uses simple javascript click functions. 

The whole site is completely responsive, so there is not a separate theme for mobile. It all works together.

Finally, the logo was built in Adobe Illustrator.
